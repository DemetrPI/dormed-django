# Dormed-Django

Dormed-Django is a full-stack web application built with Django and React. The application was developed as a multi-language platform for a sanatorium in Busko-Zdr√≥j, Poland. It is designed to handle a variety of services including room reservations, treatment scheduling, and general information dissemination.

## Technologies Used

The following technologies were used in the development of this application:

- Python
- Django
- React
- MySQL
- Django REST API
- HTML
- CSS
- React i18n

The application's Front-End was developed using React while the Back-End was developed using Python and Django. Django REST API was used to fetch data from the server, with the data being stored in a MySQL database. The site was then deployed on the Pythonanywhere service.

The website supports three languages: Ukrainian, English, and Polish. Front-End internationalization is handled using React i18n, and Back-End translation is handled with Django model-translation.

Additional features and technologies include GoogleMap API, emailJS, and React-Bootstrap for UI.
