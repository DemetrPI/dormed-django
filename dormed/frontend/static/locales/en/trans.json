  "Busko-Zdrój słynie z unikalnych w kraju i Europie siarczkowych źródeł mineralnych.": "Busko-Zdrój is famous for its unique sulfur mineral springs in Poland and Europe.",
  "Kościół św. Leonarda w Busku-Zdroju": "St. Leonard's Church in Busko-Zdrój",
  "Świątynia": "The temple, built in 1699 on the site of a previous church, is the oldest building in Busko-Zdrój. The carpenter Walenty was the executor. It was the seat of the oldest parish in Busko, established even before the foundation of the Norbertine monastery. Renovated in 1997-1998. The wooden building is built on a foundation, with a timber-frame construction reinforced with diagonal braces, oriented, single-nave, with a narrower, closed apse, a small sacristy on the north and a porch on the west. The roof over the nave and apse is common, with a gable roof covered with shingles and an arched turret covered with copper sheet. The walls are clad. Inside, there is a profiled triumphal arch beam and a Crucifixion Group with sculptures of the Virgin Mary, St. John, and a crucifix cut out of sheet metal. There are fragments of late Baroque polychrome on the ceiling of the apse. In the late Baroque altar, there is a statue of St. Leonard. The church houses a sculpture of the Virgin Mary with movable arms at the elbow and shoulder joints, modeled on 18th-century German dolls.",
  "Pierwszy": "The first document mentioning the mineral waters in Busko dates back to a privilege granted by Bolesław the Bashful in 1252. The first research on the use of the waters for medical purposes was conducted by Jan Winterfeld, a physician from Pińczów, in 1808. After taking over Busko in 1820, Feliks Rzewuski built baths designed by Henryk Marconi. The opening ceremony of the spa took place in 1836. The first complete analysis of the water from the Rotunda well, based on a sample taken in August 1830, was carried out by Warsaw pharmacist Ferdynand Werner, and the results were published in 1832. The loss of city rights in 1869 had a negative impact on the development of the spa. It was not until the 1880s and 1890s, when the leaseholder was Dr. Aleksander Dobrzański, that Busko became one of the most important spas in the country. In 1890, the number of baths in the season exceeded 50,000. In 1893, geologist Aleksander Michalski drilled and put into operation four new wells, which tripled the amount of water used for medical purposes. A concise, factual characterization of the dynamics, physical properties, and chemical composition of the new wells' water was presented in 1897 by Franciszek Gervais. After World War I, visitors began to come to the spa again. Intensive expansion of the spa took place in the interwar period, among others, on the initiative of Dr. Szymon Starkiewicz, who founded the children's sanatorium'Górka'. In 1966, Busko took first place in the competition for the most beautiful Polish spa. In 1972, the largest sanatorium, 'Włókniarz', was opened. On December 30, 2008, the 'Las Winiarski' Spa Mining Plant was opened, supplying Busko sanatoriums with sulfuric waters from a new well in the village of Las Winiarski.",
